Notably, we observe that\\ncombining relative and absolute position rep-\\nresentations yields no further improvement in\\ntranslation quality. We describe an efﬁcient\\nimplementation of our method and cast it as an\\ninstance of relation-aware self-attention mech-\\nanisms that can generalize to arbitrary graph-\\nlabeled inputs.\\n1 Introduction\\nRecent approaches to sequence to sequence learn-\\ning typically leverage recurrence (Sutskever et al.,\\n2014), convolution (Gehring et al., 2017; Kalch-\\nbrenner et al., 2016), attention (Vaswani et al.,\\n2017), or a combination of recurrence and atten-\\ntion (Bahdanau et al., 2014; Cho et al., 2014; Lu-\\nong et al., 2015; Wu et al., 2016) as basic building\\nblocks. These approaches incorporate information\\nabout the sequential position of elements differ-\\nently.\\nRecurrent neural networks (RNNs) typically\\ncompute a hidden state ht, as a function of their\\ninput at time t and a previous hidden state ht−1,\\ncapturing relative and absolute positions along the\\ntime dimension directly through their sequential\\nstructure. Non-recurrent models do not necessar-\\nily consider input elements sequentially and may\\nhence require explicitly encoding position infor-\\nmation to be able to use sequence order.\\nOne common approach is to use position encod-\\nings which are combined with input elements to\\nexpose position information to the model. These\\nposition encodings can be a deterministic func-\\ntion of position (Sukhbaatar et al., 2015; Vaswani\\net al., 2017) or learned representations. Convolu-\\ntional neural networks inherently capture relative\\npositions within the kernel size of each convolu-\\ntion. They have been shown to still beneﬁt from\\nposition encodings (Gehring et al., 2017), how-\\never.\\nFor the Transformer, which employs neither\\nconvolution nor recurrence, incorporating explicit\\nrepresentations of position information is an espe-\\ncially important consideration since the model is\\notherwise entirely invariant to sequence ordering.\\nAttention-based models have therefore used posi-\\ntion encodings or biased attention weights based\\non distance (Parikh et al., 2016).\\nIn this work we present an efﬁcient way of\\nincorporating relative position representations in\\nthe self-attention mechanism of the Transformer.\\nEven when entirely replacing its absolute position\\nencodings, we demonstrate signiﬁcant improve-\\nments in translation quality on two machine trans-\\nlation tasks.\\nOur approach can be cast as a special case of ex-\\ntending the self-attention mechanism of the Trans-\\nformer to considering arbitrary relations between\\nany two elements of the input, a direction we plan\\nto explore in future work on modeling labeled, di-\\nrected graphs.\\narXiv:1803.02155v2  [cs.CL]  12 Apr 2018'),\n",

Encoder\\nlayers consist of two sublayers: self-attention\\nfollowed by a position-wise feed-forward layer.\\nDecoder layers consist of three sublayers: self-\\nattention followed by encoder-decoder attention,\\nfollowed by a position-wise feed-forward layer.\\nIt uses residual connections around each of the\\nsublayers, followed by layer normalization (Ba\\net al., 2016). The decoder uses masking in its self-\\nattention to prevent a given output position from\\nincorporating information about future output po-\\nsitions during training.\\nPosition encodings based on sinusoids of vary-\\ning frequency are added to encoder and decoder\\ninput elements prior to the ﬁrst layer. In contrast\\nto learned, absolute position representations, the\\nauthors hypothesized that sinusoidal position en-\\ncodings would help the model to generalize to se-\\nquence lengths unseen during training by allowing\\nit to learn to attend also by relative position. This\\nproperty is shared by our relative position repre-\\nsentations which, in contrast to absolute position\\nrepresentations, are invariant to the total sequence\\nlength.\\nResidual connections help propagate position\\ninformation to higher layers.\\n2.2 Self-Attention\\nSelf-attention sublayers employ hattention heads.\\nTo form the sublayer output, results from each\\nhead are concatenated and a parameterized linear\\ntransformation is applied.\\nEach attention head operates on an input se-\\nquence, x = (x1,...,x n) of n elements where\\nxi ∈ Rdx , and computes a new sequence z =\\n(z1,...,z n) of the same length where zi ∈Rdz .\\nEach output element, zi, is computed as\\nweighted sum of a linearly transformed input el-\\nements:\\nzi =\\nn∑\\nj=1\\nαij(xjWV ) (1)\\nEach weight coefﬁcient, αij, is computed using\\na softmax function:\\nαij = exp eij∑n\\nk=1 exp eik\\nAnd eij is computed using a compatibility func-\\ntion that compares two input elements:\\neij = (xiWQ)(xjWK)T\\n√dz\\n(2)\\nScaled dot product was chosen for the compat-\\nibility function, which enables efﬁcient computa-\\ntion. Linear transformations of the inputs add suf-\\nﬁcient expressive power.\\nWQ, WK, WV ∈Rdx×dz are parameter matri-\\nces. These parameter matrices are unique per layer\\nand attention head.\\n3 Proposed Architecture\\n3.1 Relation-aware Self-Attention\\nWe propose an extension to self-attention to con-\\nsider the pairwise relationships between input ele-\\nments. In this sense, we model the input as a la-\\nbeled, directed, fully-connected graph.\\nThe edge between input elements xi and xj is\\nrepresented by vectors aV\\nij,aK\\nij ∈Rda . The mo-\\ntivation for learning two distinct edge represen-\\ntations is that aV\\nij and aK\\nij are suitable for use in\\neq. (3) and eq. (4), respectively, without requiring\\nadditional linear transformations. These represen-\\ntations can be shared across attention heads. We\\nuse da = dz.\\nWe modify eq. (1) to propagate edge informa-\\ntion to the sublayer output:\\nzi =\\nn∑\\nj=1\\nαij(xjWV + aV\\nij) (3)\\nThis extension is presumably important for\\ntasks where information about the edge types se-\\nlected by a given attention head is useful to down-\\nstream encoder or decoder layers. However, as ex-\\nplored in 4.3, this may not be necessary for ma-\\nchine translation.\\nWe also, importantly, modify eq. (2) to consider\\nedges when determining compatibility:\\neij =\\nxiWQ(xjWK + aK\\nij )T\\n√dz\\n(4)\\nThe primary motivation for using simple addi-\\ntion to incorporate edge representations in eq. (3)\\nand eq. (4) is to enable an efﬁcient implementation\\ndescribed in 3.3.'),\n",

The ﬁgure assumes 2 <= k <= n−4.\\nNote that not all edges are shown.\\n3.2 Relative Position Representations\\nFor linear sequences, edges can capture infor-\\nmation about the relative position differences be-\\ntween input elements. The maximum relative po-\\nsition we consider is clipped to a maximum abso-\\nlute value of k. We hypothesized that precise rel-\\native position information is not useful beyond a\\ncertain distance.

(2017), which consid-\\ners unlabeled graph inputs to an attention model.\\nFor a sequence of length n and h attention\\nheads, we reduce the space complexity of storing\\nrelative position representations from O(hn2da)\\nto O(n2da) by sharing them across each heads.\\nAdditionally, relative position representations can\\nbe shared across sequences. Therefore, the over-\\nall self-attention space complexity increases from\\nO(bhndz) to O(bhndz + n2da). Given da = dz,\\nthe size of the relative increase depends on n\\nbh.\\nThe Transformer computes self-attention efﬁ-\\nciently for all sequences, heads, and positions in\\na batch using parallel matrix multiplication opera-\\ntions (Vaswani et al., 2017). Without relative posi-\\ntion representations, each eij can be computed us-\\ning bhparallel multiplications of n×dz and dz ×n\\nmatrices. Each matrix multiplication computes eij\\nfor all sequence positions, for a particular head\\nand sequence. For any sequence and head, this\\nrequires sharing the same representation for each\\nposition across all compatibility function applica-\\ntions (dot products) with other positions.\\nWhen we consider relative positions the repre-\\nsentations differ with different pairs of positions.\\nThis prevents us from computing all eij for all\\npairs of positions in a single matrix multiplication.\\nWe also want to avoid broadcasting relative po-\\nsition representations. However, both issues can\\nbe resolved by splitting the computation of eq. (4)\\ninto two terms:\\neij =\\nxiWQ(xjWK)T + xiWQ(aK\\nij )T\\n√dz\\n(5)\\nThe ﬁrst term is identical to eq. (2), and can be\\ncomputed as described above. For the second term\\ninvolving relative position representations, tensor\\nreshaping can be used to computenparallel multi-\\nplications of bh×dz and dz×nmatrices. Each ma-\\ntrix multiplication computes contributions to eij\\nfor all heads and batches, corresponding to a par-\\nticular sequence position. Further reshaping al-\\nlows adding the two terms. The same approach\\ncan be used to efﬁciently compute eq. (3).\\nFor our machine translation experiments, the re-\\nsult was a modest 7% decrease in steps per sec-\\nond, but we were able to maintain the same model\\nand batch sizes on P100 GPUs as Vaswani et\\nal.

In this new version, we apply\\nseveral known technical modifications to the Transformer architecture, such as interleaving local-global\\nattentions (Beltagy et al., 2020a) and group-query attention (Ainslie et al., 2023). We also train the 2B\\nand 9B models with knowledge distillation (Hinton et al., 2015) instead of next token prediction. The\\nresulting models deliver the best performance for their size, and even offer competitive alternatives to\\nmodels that are 2-3×bigger. We release all our models to the community.\\n1. Introduction\\nLarge language models (LLMs) have demon-\\nstrated strong capabilities in language under-\\nstanding,generation,andreasoning(Brownetal.,\\n2020; Radford et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2019).\\nScaling has been key to this recent progress,\\nwith many new capabilities only emerging at\\nscale (Brown et al., 2020). The newest large mod-\\nels not only reach unprecedented performance\\non reasoning benchmarks (Achiam et al., 2023),\\nbut they also demonstrate multimodal and mul-\\ntilingual capabilities (Gemini Team, 2024) and\\neven the ability to use context lengths of over 1M\\ntokens (Gemini Team, 2024).\\nSmall-scale models have also shown a rapid\\nincrease in performance, but these gains are\\nlargelyderivedfromincreasingthelengthoftrain-\\ning (Gemma Team, 2024; Jiang et al., 2023; Tou-\\nvron et al., 2023). This approach only scales log-\\narithmically with dataset size (Hoffmann et al.,\\n2022), and the latest small models require up to\\n15T tokens to improve the state of the art by less\\nthan 1-2% (AI@Meta, 2024).\\nYet, these continued improvements provide ev-\\nidence that small models are still under-trained.\\nIn this work, we explore alternatives to improve\\nsmall model performance without solely increas-\\ning training length. One solution is to improve\\nthe quality of information received by the net-\\nwork at each training step by replacing the next\\ntoken prediction task with a richer objective.\\nInparticular, wefocusoureffortsonknowledge\\ndistillation (Hinton et al., 2015), which replaces\\nthe one-hot vector seen at each token with the\\ndistribution of potential next tokens computed\\nfrom a large model. This approach is often used\\nto reduce the training time of smaller models\\nby giving them richer gradients. In this work,\\nwe instead train for large quantities of tokens\\nwith distillation in order to simulate training be-\\nyond the number of available tokens. Concretely,\\nwe use a large language model as a teacher to\\ntrain small models, namely 2B and 9B models,\\non a quantity of tokens that is more than 50×\\nthe compute-optimal quantity predicted by the\\ntheory (Hoffmann et al., 2022). Along with the\\nmodels trained with distillation, we also release\\na 27B model trained from scratch for this work.\\nWe also leverage several known modifications\\nofTransformers,namelytheinterleavingofglobal\\nand local attention layers from Beltagy et al.\\n(2020a),andtheGrouped-QueryAttention(GQA)\\nmechanism of Ainslie et al. (2023).\\nOverall, Gemma 2 significantly advances state-\\nof-the-art performance relative to comparable-\\nscale open models and are even competitive\\nwith some models more than twice their size\\n(AI@Meta, 2024; Almazrouei et al., 2023; Jiang\\net al., 2023; xAI, 2024), across a variety of au-\\ntomated benchmarks and human evaluations.\\nExample domains include question answering\\n(Clark et al., 2019; Kwiatkowski et al., 2019),\\ncommonsense reasoning (Sakaguchi et al., 2019;\\nSuzgun et al., 2022), mathematics and science\\n(Cobbe et al., 2021; Hendrycks et al., 2020), and\\ncoding (Austin et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2021).\\n1See Contributions and Acknowledgments section for full author list.

Pre-training\\nWe provide a brief overview of the parts of our\\npre-training that differs from Gemma 1.\\n3.1. Training Data\\nWe train Gemma 2 27B on 13 trillion tokens of\\nprimarily-English data, the 9B model on 8 trillion\\ntokens, and the 2B on 2 trillion tokens. These\\ntokens come from a variety of data sources, in-\\ncluding web documents, code, and science ar-\\nticles. Our models are not multimodal and are\\nnot trained specifically for state-of-the-art multi-\\nlingual capabilities. The final data mixture was\\ndetermined through ablations similar to the ap-\\nproach in Gemini 1.0 (Gemini Team, 2023).\\nTokenizer.We use the same tokenizer as Gemma\\n1 and Gemini: a SentencePiece tokenizer with\\nsplit digits, preserved whitespace, and byte-level\\nencodings (Kudo and Richardson, 2018). The\\nresulting vocabulary has 256k entries.\\nFiltering. We use the same data filtering tech-\\nniques as Gemma 1. Specifically, we filter the pre-\\ntraining dataset to reduce the risk of unwanted\\nor unsafe utterances, filter out certain personal\\ninformation or other sensitive data, decontami-\\nnate evaluation sets from our pre-training data\\nmixture, and reduce the risk of recitation by min-\\nimizing the proliferation of sensitive outputs.\\nShards\\nModel Type #Chips Data Model\\n2B TPUv5e 512 512 1\\n9B TPUv4 4096 1024 4\\n27B TPUv5p 6144 768 8\\nTable 3|Training infrastructure with sharding.\\n3.2. Knowledge Distillation\\nGiven a large model used as a teacher, we learn\\nsmaller models by distilling from the probability\\ngiven by the teacher of each token𝑥 given its\\ncontext 𝑥𝑐, i.e., 𝑃𝑇(𝑥 |𝑥𝑐). More precisely, we\\nminimize the negative log-likelihood between the\\nContext Relevant Token\\nUser turn user\\nModel turn model\\nStart of conversation turn <start_of_turn>\\nEnd of conversation turn <end_of_turn>\\nBeginning of sequence <bos>\\nEnd of sequence <eos>\\nTable 4|Relevant formatting control tokens used\\nfor Gemma models.\\nprobabilities from the teacher and the student:\\nmin\\n𝑃𝑆\\n∑︁\\n𝑥\\n−𝑃𝑇(𝑥 |𝑥𝑐)log 𝑃𝑆(𝑥 |𝑥𝑐),\\nwhere 𝑃𝑆 is the parameterized probability of the\\nstudent. Note that knowledge distillation was\\nalso used in Gemini 1.5 (Gemini Team, 2024).\\n3.3. Compute Infrastructure\\nWe train our models with TPUv4, TPUv5e, and\\nTPUv5p as outlined in Table 3. For the 2B model,\\nwe train on a 2x16x16 configuration of TPUv5e,\\ntotaling 512 chips, with 512-way data replication\\nand 1-way model sharding. For the 9B model,\\nwe train on an 8x16x32 configuration of TPUv4,\\ntotaling 4096 chips, with 1024-way data repli-\\ncation and 4-way model sharding. For the 27B\\nmodel, we train on an 8x24x32 configuration of\\nTPUv5p, totaling 6144 chips, with 768-way data\\nreplication and 8-way model sharding.\\nThe optimizer state is further sharded using\\ntechniques similar to ZeRO-3 (Ren et al., 2021).\\nFor scales beyond a single pod, we perform a\\ndata-replica reduction over the data center net-\\nwork, using the Pathways approach of Barham\\net al. (2022). We also use the ’single controller’\\nprogramming paradigm of Jax (Roberts et al.,\\n2023) and Pathways (Barham et al., 2022).

Memorization and Privacy\\nLarge language models may, under particular cir-\\ncumstances, be vulnerable to attacks causing the\\nmodeltoproducememorized 1 trainingdata(Nasr\\net al., 2023). To study susceptibility to such at-\\ntacks and quantify memorization, we evaluate\\nmodels for verbatim and approximate memoriza-\\ntion as was done in several prior studies (Anil\\net al., 2023; Carlini et al., 2022; Gemini Team,\\n2024; Kudugunta et al., 2023).\\nWe follow the evaluation setting of (Gemma\\nTeam, 2024) which tests for (50 token) memo-\\nrizations of training data given a prompt of 50 to-\\nkens. Wecomparetheoverallmemorizationrates,\\nacross a uniform sample of the entire dataset, us-\\ning both an exact match criteria and approximate\\nmatch criteria (Ippolito et al., 2022) using an edit\\ndistance of 10%.\\nVerbatim Memorization:Results are in Figure 1.\\nWe first compare against recent models from the\\nliterature that include memorization evaluations.\\nWe find that Gemma 2 memorizes significantly\\nless than prior models at a similar size, with mem-\\norization rates below 0.1% (note the log y-axis).\\nWe further investigate how this memorization\\nbreaks down with respect to the data source. Sim-\\nilar to Gemma 1, we find that Gemma 2 memo-\\nrizes more from code, wiki, and science sources,\\nandalsothatitmemorizessignificantlylessacross\\nthe board (again, note the log y-axis).\\nApproximate Memorization: Figure 1 also\\npresents approximate memorization by data\\nsource. We observe that while approximate mem-\\norization is higher than exact, the rate of memo-\\nrization is still low. For example, the approximate\\nmemorization of this model is much lower than\\neven the exact memorization of Gemma 1. We\\n1This work uses a very restricted definition of “mem-\\norization”: whether a model can be induced to generate\\nnear-copies of some training examples when prompted with\\nappropriate instructions. We do not mean to say that a\\nmodel ’contains’ its training data in the sense that any arbi-\\ntrary instance of that data can be retrieved without use of\\nspecialized software or algorithms. Rather, if a model can\\nbe induced to generate measurably close copies of certain\\ntraining examples by supplying appropriate instructions to\\nguide the model’s statistical generation process then that\\nmodel is said to have ’memorized’ those examples.\\nGemma 2 2BGemma 2 9BGemma 2 27BGemini 1.5 Flash\\nGemma2BGemma7BPaLM 2Small\\nModel\\n0.1\\n1\\n% Exact Memorized\\nOverall Memorization Rate\\nCode\\nMultilingual\\nScience\\nWeb Wiki\\nData Source\\n10 4\\n10 3\\n0.01\\n0.1\\n% Memorized\\nBy Data Source\\nBy Data Source\\nExact 2B\\nExact 9B\\nExact 27B\\nApprox 2B\\nApprox 9B\\nApprox 27B\\nFigure 1 |Comparing memorization rates.

Responsibility, Safety, Security\\nResponsibility, safety and security are of\\nparamount importance when developing Gemma\\nmodels. To reduce risks to Gemma 2 users, we\\nhave integrated enhanced internal safety pro-\\ncesses that span the development workflow, in\\nline with recent Google AI models (Gemini Team,\\n2024). Similar to the inaugural Gemma release,\\nwehavefollowedathreepillarapproachwhichfo-\\ncuses on safety mitigation at training time, robust\\nand transparent model evaluations, and further\\ndevelopment of the Responsible Generative AI\\nToolkit, a series of models and tools to help de-\\nvelopers implement responsibility and safety best\\npractices for their applications.\\n8.1. Impact assessment\\nOur approach and resulting impact assessment is\\nreflective of that outlined for Gemma 1 (Gemma\\nTeam, 2024): we continue to believe that open-\\nness in AI can spread the benefits of these tech-\\nnologies across society, but must be evaluated\\nagainst the risk of malicious uses, such as the\\ncreation of deepfake imagery, AI-generated disin-\\nformation or illegal and disturbing material, that\\ncan cause harm on both an individual and insti-\\ntutional levels (Weidinger et al., 2021). Since the\\nlaunch of Gemma 1, we have seen our Gemma\\nmodels drive a number of socially beneficial ap-\\nplications, relying on Gemma’s unique technolo-\\ngies like its tokenizer to facilitate the creation of\\nmultilingual models, such as for Navarasa 2.0, a\\nGemma tuned model for 15 Indian languages.\\nReleasing further open models requires specific\\nattention to changes in model capabilities and\\nclosemonitoringoftheevolvingrisksofLLMs(Lin\\net al., 2024), as well as, an understanding of the\\nways in which our models are being used in the\\nwild. Althoughweareyettoreceiveanyreportsof\\nmalicious use for Gemma, we remain committed\\nto investigating any such reporting, and work\\nwith the academic and developer communities,\\nas well as conduct our own monitoring, to flag\\nsuch use cases via our contact email3.\\nDespite advancements in capabilities, we be-\\n3gemma-2-report@google.com\\nlieve that given the number of larger and more\\npowerful open models, this release will have a\\nnegligible effect on the overall risk landscape.\\n8.2. Safety policies and train-time mitigations\\nA key pillar of Gemma’s approach to safety is to\\nalign fine-tuned models with Google’s safety poli-\\ncies, in line with Gemini models (Gemini Team,\\n2023). They are designed to help prevent our\\nmodels from generating harmful content, i.e.,\\n• Child sexual abuse and exploitation\\n• Revealingpersonallyidentifiableinformation\\nthat can lead to harm (e.g., Social Security\\nnumbers)\\n• Hate speech and harassment\\n• Dangerous or malicious content (including\\npromoting self-harm or instructing in harm-\\nful activities)\\n• Sexually explicit content\\n• Medicaladvicethatrunscontrarytoscientific\\nor medical consensus\\nWe undertook considerable safety filtering of our\\npre-training data to reduce the likelihood of our\\npre-trainedandfine-tunedcheckpointsproducing\\nharmful content. For fine-tuned models, we also\\nuse both SFT and RLHF to steer the model away\\nfrom undesirable behavior.\\n8.3. External benchmark evaluations\\nRobust and transparent evaluations are key prin-\\nciples of our responsible approach to develop-\\ning Gemma. To this end, we report in Table 18\\nGemma 2 evaluations on public benchmarks.\\n8.4. Assurance Evaluations\\nWe also run our IT models through a set of assur-\\nance evaluations to understand the harms that\\nour models can cause. We focus on capabilities\\nrelevant to extreme risks (Shevlane et al., 2023)\\n(Phuong et al., 2024). Specifically, we evaluate on\\noffensive cyber-security, code vulnerability detec-\\ntion, Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nu-\\nclear (CBRN) knowledge, and self-proliferation.\\nWe refer the reader to Phuong et al. (2024) for\\nfull methodological details of these studies.\\n10'),\n",

Ourapproachtoresponsibleopenmodels\\nDesigning safe, secure and responsible applica-\\ntions requires a system-level approach, working\\nto mitigate risks associated with each specific use\\ncase and environment. Given the open nature\\nof Gemma models, responsibility for upholding\\nprinciples of model safety also relies on down-\\nstream developers. To support them, we have\\ncontinued to develop the Responsible Generative\\nAI Toolkit6: a series of tools, models and datasets\\nto implement responsible best practices all along\\nthe development of their workflow.\\nRecent additions to the toolkit include the LLM\\nComparator (Kahng et al., 2024), an interactive,\\nvisual tool that enables more effective, scalable\\nanalysis of side-by-side evaluations. Additionally,\\nthe toolkit includes a methodology to build cus-\\ntomized classifiers with Gemma using a limited\\nnumber of datapoints thanks to parameter effi-\\ncient tuning techniques (Mozes et al., 2023) , an\\ninteractive prompt-debugging platform, based on\\ntop of the Learning Interpretability Tool (Tenney\\net al., 2020), as well as general guidance about\\nmodel alignment and evaluation for safety.\\n9. Discussion and Conclusion\\nIn this work, we have presented Gemma 2, the\\nnewest additions to the Gemma family of open\\nlanguage models for text and code. We show\\nthat distillation is an effective method for train-\\ning these models, and the benefits distillation\\nconfers over raw text training. Specifically, we\\nshow how training over output probabilities can\\nproduce superior results over purely next token\\n6https://ai.google.dev/responsible\\nprediction. We hope that releasing these models\\nto the community will unlock access to capabili-\\nties previously only seen in large-scale LLMs and\\nfuel future waves of research and development.\\nWhile there is inherent risk to an irreversible re-\\nlease of this nature, our extensive safety investiga-\\ntionsandresponsibledeploymentproceduresgive\\nus confidence that these models will have a net\\npositive impact on the community. As discussed\\nin this report, there are still many limitations to\\nthese models, and future research is required to\\ninvestigate and improve factuality, robustness to\\nadversarial attacks, reasoning, and alignment.\\n14'),\n",

Our model efﬁciently leverages\\nstatistical information by training only on\\nthe nonzero elements in a word-word co-\\noccurrence matrix, rather than on the en-\\ntire sparse matrix or on individual context\\nwindows in a large corpus. The model pro-\\nduces a vector space with meaningful sub-\\nstructure, as evidenced by its performance\\nof 75% on a recent word analogy task. It\\nalso outperforms related models on simi-\\nlarity tasks and named entity recognition.\\n1 Introduction\\nSemantic vector space models of language repre-\\nsent each word with a real-valued vector. These\\nvectors can be used as features in a variety of ap-\\nplications, such as information retrieval (Manning\\net al., 2008), document classiﬁcation (Sebastiani,\\n2002), question answering (Tellex et al., 2003),\\nnamed entity recognition (Turian et al., 2010), and\\nparsing (Socher et al., 2013).\\nMost word vector methods rely on the distance\\nor angle between pairs of word vectors as the pri-\\nmary method for evaluating the intrinsic quality\\nof such a set of word representations. Recently,\\nMikolov et al. (2013c) introduced a new evalua-\\ntion scheme based on word analogies that probes\\nthe ﬁner structure of the word vector space by ex-\\namining not the scalar distance between word vec-\\ntors, but rather their various dimensions of dif-\\nference. For example, the analogy “king is to\\nqueen as man is to woman” should be encoded\\nin the vector space by the vector equation king −\\nqueen = man −woman. This evaluation scheme\\nfavors models that produce dimensions of mean-\\ning, thereby capturing the multi-clustering idea of\\ndistributed representations (Bengio, 2009).\\nThe two main model families for learning word\\nvectors are: 1) global matrix factorization meth-\\nods, such as latent semantic analysis (LSA) (Deer-\\nwester et al., 1990) and 2) local context window\\nmethods, such as the skip-gram model of Mikolov\\net al. (2013c). Currently, both families suffer sig-\\nniﬁcant drawbacks. While methods like LSA ef-\\nﬁciently leverage statistical information, they do\\nrelatively poorly on the word analogy task, indi-\\ncating a sub-optimal vector space structure. Meth-\\nods like skip-gram may do better on the analogy\\ntask, but they poorly utilize the statistics of the cor-\\npus since they train on separate local context win-\\ndows instead of on global co-occurrence counts.\\nIn this work, we analyze the model properties\\nnecessary to produce linear directions of meaning\\nand argue that global log-bilinear regression mod-\\nels are appropriate for doing so. We propose a spe-\\nciﬁc weighted least squares model that trains on\\nglobal word-word co-occurrence counts and thus\\nmakes efﬁcient use of statistics. The model pro-\\nduces a word vector space with meaningful sub-\\nstructure, as evidenced by its state-of-the-art per-\\nformance of 75% accuracy on the word analogy\\ndataset. We also demonstrate that our methods\\noutperform other current methods on several word\\nsimilarity tasks, and also on a common named en-\\ntity recognition (NER) benchmark.\\nWe provide the source code for the model as\\nwell as trained word vectors at http://nlp.\\nstanford.edu/projects/glove/.'),\n",

Matrix factor-\\nization methods for generating low-dimensional\\nword representations have roots stretching as far\\nback as LSA. These methods utilize low-rank ap-\\nproximations to decompose large matrices that\\ncapture statistical information about a corpus. The\\nparticular type of information captured by such\\nmatrices varies by application. In LSA, the ma-\\ntrices are of “term-document” type, i.e., the rows\\ncorrespond to words or terms, and the columns\\ncorrespond to different documents in the corpus.\\nIn contrast, the Hyperspace Analogue to Language\\n(HAL) (Lund and Burgess, 1996), for example,\\nutilizes matrices of “term-term” type, i.e., the rows\\nand columns correspond to words and the entries\\ncorrespond to the number of times a given word\\noccurs in the context of another given word.\\nA main problem with HAL and related meth-\\nods is that the most frequent words contribute a\\ndisproportionate amount to the similarity measure:\\nthe number of times two words co-occur with the\\nor and, for example, will have a large effect on\\ntheir similarity despite conveying relatively little\\nabout their semantic relatedness. A number of\\ntechniques exist that addresses this shortcoming of\\nHAL, such as the COALS method (Rohde et al.,\\n2006), in which the co-occurrence matrix is ﬁrst\\ntransformed by an entropy- or correlation-based\\nnormalization. An advantage of this type of trans-\\nformation is that the raw co-occurrence counts,\\nwhich for a reasonably sized corpus might span\\n8 or 9 orders of magnitude, are compressed so as\\nto be distributed more evenly in a smaller inter-\\nval. A variety of newer models also pursue this\\napproach, including a study (Bullinaria and Levy,\\n2007) that indicates that positive pointwise mu-\\ntual information (PPMI) is a good transformation.\\nMore recently, a square root type transformation\\nin the form of Hellinger PCA (HPCA) (Lebret and\\nCollobert, 2014) has been suggested as an effec-\\ntive way of learning word representations.\\nShallow Window-Based Methods. Another\\napproach is to learn word representations that aid\\nin making predictions within local context win-\\ndows. For example, Bengio et al. (2003) intro-\\nduced a model that learns word vector representa-\\ntions as part of a simple neural network architec-\\nture for language modeling. Collobert and Weston\\n(2008) decoupled the word vector training from\\nthe downstream training objectives, which paved\\nthe way for Collobert et al. (2011) to use the full\\ncontext of a word for learning the word represen-\\ntations, rather than just the preceding context as is\\nthe case with language models.\\nRecently, the importance of the full neural net-\\nwork structure for learning useful word repre-\\nsentations has been called into question. The\\nskip-gram and continuous bag-of-words (CBOW)\\nmodels of Mikolov et al. (2013a) propose a sim-\\nple single-layer architecture based on the inner\\nproduct between two word vectors. Mnih and\\nKavukcuoglu (2013) also proposed closely-related\\nvector log-bilinear models, vLBL and ivLBL, and\\nLevy et al. (2014) proposed explicit word embed-\\ndings based on a PPMI metric.\\nIn the skip-gram and ivLBL models, the objec-\\ntive is to predict a word’s context given the word\\nitself, whereas the objective in the CBOW and\\nvLBL models is to predict a word given its con-\\ntext. Through evaluation on a word analogy task,\\nthese models demonstrated the capacity to learn\\nlinguistic patterns as linear relationships between\\nthe word vectors.\\nUnlike the matrix factorization methods, the\\nshallow window-based methods suffer from the\\ndisadvantage that they do not operate directly on\\nthe co-occurrence statistics of the corpus. Instead,\\nthese models scan context windows across the en-\\ntire corpus, which fails to take advantage of the\\nvast amount of repetition in the data.\\n3 The GloVe Model\\nThe statistics of word occurrences in a corpus is\\nthe primary source of information available to all\\nunsupervised methods for learning word represen-\\ntations, and although many such methods now ex-\\nist, the question still remains as to how meaning\\nis generated from these statistics, and how the re-\\nsulting word vectors might represent that meaning.\\nIn this section, we shed some light on this ques-\\ntion. We use our insights to construct a new model\\nfor word representation which we call GloVe, for\\nGlobal Vectors, because the global corpus statis-\\ntics are captured directly by the model.\\nFirst we establish some notation. Let the matrix\\nof word-word co-occurrence counts be denoted by\\nX, whose entries Xi jtabulate the number of times\\nword j occurs in the context of word i. Let Xi =∑\\nk Xik be the number of times any word appears\\nin the context of wordi. Finally, let Pi j = P( j|i) =\\nXi j/Xi be the probability that word j appear in the'),\n",

Con-\\nsider two words i and j that exhibit a particular as-\\npect of interest; for concreteness, suppose we are\\ninterested in the concept of thermodynamic phase,\\nfor which we might take i = ice and j = steam.\\nThe relationship of these words can be examined\\nby studying the ratio of their co-occurrence prob-\\nabilities with various probe words, k. For words\\nk related to ice but not steam, say k = solid, we\\nexpect the ratio Pik /Pjk will be large. Similarly,\\nfor words k related to steam but not ice, say k =\\ngas, the ratio should be small. For words k like\\nwater or fashion, that are either related to both ice\\nand steam, or to neither, the ratio should be close\\nto one. Table 1 shows these probabilities and their\\nratios for a large corpus, and the numbers conﬁrm\\nthese expectations. Compared to the raw probabil-\\nities, the ratio is better able to distinguish relevant\\nwords (solid and gas) from irrelevant words (water\\nand fashion) and it is also better able to discrimi-\\nnate between the two relevant words.\\nThe above argument suggests that the appropri-\\nate starting point for word vector learning should\\nbe with ratios of co-occurrence probabilities rather\\nthan the probabilities themselves. Noting that the\\nratio Pik /Pjk depends on three words i, j, and k,\\nthe most general model takes the form,\\nF(wi,wj , ˜wk ) = Pik\\nPjk\\n, (1)\\nwhere w ∈ Rd are word vectors and ˜ w ∈ Rd\\nare separate context word vectors whose role will\\nbe discussed in Section 4.2. In this equation, the\\nright-hand side is extracted from the corpus, and\\nF may depend on some as-of-yet unspeciﬁed pa-\\nrameters. The number of possibilities forF is vast,\\nbut by enforcing a few desiderata we can select a\\nunique choice. First, we would like F to encode\\nthe information present the ratio Pik /Pjk in the\\nword vector space. Since vector spaces are inher-\\nently linear structures, the most natural way to do\\nthis is with vector differences. With this aim, we\\ncan restrict our consideration to those functions F\\nthat depend only on the difference of the two target\\nwords, modifying Eqn. (1) to,\\nF(wi −wj , ˜wk ) = Pik\\nPjk\\n. (2)\\nNext, we note that the arguments of F in Eqn. (2)\\nare vectors while the right-hand side is a scalar.\\nWhile F could be taken to be a complicated func-\\ntion parameterized by, e.g., a neural network, do-\\ning so would obfuscate the linear structure we are\\ntrying to capture. To avoid this issue, we can ﬁrst\\ntake the dot product of the arguments,\\nF\\n(\\n(wi −wj )T ˜wk\\n)\\n= Pik\\nPjk\\n, (3)\\nwhich prevents F from mixing the vector dimen-\\nsions in undesirable ways. Next, note that for\\nword-word co-occurrence matrices, the distinction\\nbetween a word and a context word is arbitrary and\\nthat we are free to exchange the two roles. To do so\\nconsistently, we must not only exchange w ↔ ˜w\\nbut also X ↔XT . Our ﬁnal model should be in-\\nvariant under this relabeling, but Eqn.

(1),\\nbut it is actually ill-deﬁned since the logarithm di-\\nverges whenever its argument is zero. One reso-\\nlution to this issue is to include an additive shift\\nin the logarithm, log( Xik ) →log(1 + Xik ), which\\nmaintains the sparsity of X while avoiding the di-\\nvergences. The idea of factorizing the log of the\\nco-occurrence matrix is closely related to LSA and\\nwe will use the resulting model as a baseline in\\nour experiments. A main drawback to this model\\nis that it weighs all co-occurrences equally, even\\nthose that happen rarely or never. Such rare co-\\noccurrences are noisy and carry less information\\nthan the more frequent ones — yet even just the\\nzero entries account for 75–95% of the data in X,\\ndepending on the vocabulary size and corpus.\\nWe propose a new weighted least squares re-\\ngression model that addresses these problems.\\nCasting Eqn.

Nevertheless, cer-\\ntain models remain somewhat opaque in this re-\\ngard, particularly the recent window-based meth-\\nods like skip-gram and ivLBL. Therefore, in this\\nsubsection we show how these models are related\\nto our proposed model, as deﬁned in Eqn. (8).\\nThe starting point for the skip-gram or ivLBL\\nmethods is a model Qi j for the probability that\\nword j appears in the context of word i. For con-\\ncreteness, let us assume that Qi jis a softmax,\\nQi j = exp(wT\\ni ˜wj )\\n∑V\\nk=1 exp(wT\\ni ˜wk )\\n. (10)\\nMost of the details of these models are irrelevant\\nfor our purposes, aside from the the fact that they\\nattempt to maximize the log probability as a con-\\ntext window scans over the corpus. Training pro-\\nceeds in an on-line, stochastic fashion, but the im-\\nplied global objective function can be written as,\\nJ = −\\n∑\\ni∈corpus\\nj∈context(i)\\nlog Qi j. (11)\\nEvaluating the normalization factor of the soft-\\nmax for each term in this sum is costly. To al-\\nlow for efﬁcient training, the skip-gram and ivLBL\\nmodels introduce approximations to Qi j. How-\\never, the sum in Eqn. (11) can be evaluated much'),\n",

As a weighted sum of cross-entropy error,\\nthis objective bears some formal resemblance to\\nthe weighted least squares objective of Eqn. (8).\\nIn fact, it is possible to optimize Eqn. (13) directly\\nas opposed to the on-line training methods used in\\nthe skip-gram and ivLBL models. One could inter-\\npret this objective as a “global skip-gram” model,\\nand it might be interesting to investigate further.\\nOn the other hand, Eqn. (13) exhibits a number of\\nundesirable properties that ought to be addressed\\nbefore adopting it as a model for learning word\\nvectors.\\nTo begin, cross entropy error is just one among\\nmany possible distance measures between prob-\\nability distributions, and it has the unfortunate\\nproperty that distributions with long tails are of-\\nten modeled poorly with too much weight given\\nto the unlikely events. Furthermore, for the mea-\\nsure to be bounded it requires that the model dis-\\ntribution Q be properly normalized. This presents\\na computational bottleneck owing to the sum over\\nthe whole vocabulary in Eqn. (10), and it would be\\ndesirable to consider a different distance measure\\nthat did not require this property of Q. A natural\\nchoice would be a least squares objective in which\\nnormalization factors in Q and P are discarded,\\nˆJ =\\n∑\\ni,j\\nXi\\n( ˆPi j− ˆQi j\\n)2 (14)\\nwhere ˆPi j = Xi j and ˆQi j = exp(wT\\ni ˜wj ) are the\\nunnormalized distributions. At this stage another\\nproblem emerges, namely thatXi joften takes very\\nlarge values, which can complicate the optimiza-\\ntion. An effective remedy is to minimize the\\nsquared error of the logarithms of ˆP and ˆQ instead,\\nˆJ =\\n∑\\ni,j\\nXi\\n(log ˆPi j−log ˆQi j\\n)2\\n=\\n∑\\ni,j\\nXi\\n(wT\\ni ˜wj −log Xi j\\n)2 . (15)\\nFinally, we observe that while the weighting factor\\nXi is preordained by the on-line training method\\ninherent to the skip-gram and ivLBL models, it is\\nby no means guaranteed to be optimal. In fact,\\nMikolov et al. (2013a) observe that performance\\ncan be increased by ﬁltering the data so as to re-\\nduce the effective value of the weighting factor for\\nfrequent words. With this in mind, we introduce\\na more general weighting function, which we are\\nfree to take to depend on the context word as well.\\nThe result is,\\nˆJ =\\n∑\\ni,j\\nf (Xi j)(wT\\ni ˜wj −log Xi j\\n)2 , (16)\\nwhich is equivalent 1 to the cost function of\\nEqn. (8), which we derived previously.\\n3.2 Complexity of the model\\nAs can be seen from Eqn. (8) and the explicit form\\nof the weighting function f (X), the computational\\ncomplexity of the model depends on the number of\\nnonzero elements in the matrix X. As this num-\\nber is always less than the total number of en-\\ntries of the matrix, the model scales no worse than\\nO(|V |2). At ﬁrst glance this might seem like a sub-\\nstantial improvement over the shallow window-\\nbased approaches, which scale with the corpus\\nsize, |C|. However, typical vocabularies have hun-\\ndreds of thousands of words, so that |V |2 can be in\\nthe hundreds of billions, which is actually much\\nlarger than most corpora. For this reason it is im-\\nportant to determine whether a tighter bound can\\nbe placed on the number of nonzero elements of\\nX.\\nIn order to make any concrete statements about\\nthe number of nonzero elements in X, it is neces-\\nsary to make some assumptions about the distribu-\\ntion of word co-occurrences. In particular, we will\\nassume that the number of co-occurrences of word\\ni with word j, Xi j, can be modeled as a power-law\\nfunction of the frequency rank of that word pair,\\nri j:\\nXi j = k\\n(ri j)α .

In all cases we use a decreasing weighting\\nfunction, so that word pairs that are d words apart\\ncontribute 1/d to the total count. This is one way\\nto account for the fact that very distant word pairs\\nare expected to contain less relevant information\\nabout the words’ relationship to one another.\\nFor all our experiments, we set xmax = 100,\\nα = 3/4, and train the model using AdaGrad\\n(Duchi et al., 2011), stochastically sampling non-\\nzero elements from X, with initial learning rate of\\n0.05.

A context\\nwindow that extends to the left and right of a tar-\\nget word will be called symmetric, and one which\\nextends only to the left will be called asymmet-\\nric. In (a), we observe diminishing returns for vec-\\ntors larger than about 200 dimensions. In (b) and\\n(c), we examine the effect of varying the window\\nsize for symmetric and asymmetric context win-\\ndows. Performance is better on the syntactic sub-\\ntask for small and asymmetric context windows,\\nwhich aligns with the intuition that syntactic infor-\\nmation is mostly drawn from the immediate con-\\ntext and can depend strongly on word order. Se-\\nmantic information, on the other hand, is more fre-\\nquently non-local, and more of it is captured with\\nlarger window sizes.\\n4.5 Model Analysis: Corpus Size\\nIn Fig. 3, we show performance on the word anal-\\nogy task for 300-dimensional vectors trained on\\ndifferent corpora. On the syntactic subtask, there\\nis a monotonic increase in performance as the cor-\\npus size increases. This is to be expected since\\nlarger corpora typically produce better statistics.\\nInterestingly, the same trend is not true for the se-\\nmantic subtask, where the models trained on the\\nsmaller Wikipedia corpora do better than those\\ntrained on the larger Gigaword corpus. This is\\nlikely due to the large number of city- and country-\\nbased analogies in the analogy dataset and the fact\\nthat Wikipedia has fairly comprehensive articles\\nfor most such locations.

The former depends on\\nmany factors, including window size, vocabulary\\nsize, and corpus size. Though we did not do so,\\nthis step could easily be parallelized across mul-\\ntiple machines (see, e.g., Lebret and Collobert\\n(2014) for some benchmarks). Using a single\\nthread of a dual 2.1GHz Intel Xeon E5-2658 ma-\\nchine, populating X with a 10 word symmetric\\ncontext window, a 400,000 word vocabulary, and\\na 6 billion token corpus takes about 85 minutes.\\nGiven X, the time it takes to train the model de-\\npends on the vector size and the number of itera-\\ntions.

Unlike recent language repre-\\nsentation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Rad-\\nford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pre-\\ntrain deep bidirectional representations from\\nunlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both\\nleft and right context in all layers. As a re-\\nsult, the pre-trained BERT model can be ﬁne-\\ntuned with just one additional output layer\\nto create state-of-the-art models for a wide\\nrange of tasks, such as question answering and\\nlanguage inference, without substantial task-\\nspeciﬁc architecture modiﬁcations.\\nBERT is conceptually simple and empirically\\npowerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art re-\\nsults on eleven natural language processing\\ntasks, including pushing the GLUE score to\\n80.5% (7.7% point absolute improvement),\\nMultiNLI accuracy to 86.7% (4.6% absolute\\nimprovement), SQuAD v1.1 question answer-\\ning Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute im-\\nprovement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1\\n(5.1 point absolute improvement).\\n1 Introduction\\nLanguage model pre-training has been shown to\\nbe effective for improving many natural language\\nprocessing tasks (Dai and Le, 2015; Peters et al.,\\n2018a; Radford et al., 2018; Howard and Ruder,\\n2018). These include sentence-level tasks such as\\nnatural language inference (Bowman et al., 2015;\\nWilliams et al., 2018) and paraphrasing (Dolan\\nand Brockett, 2005), which aim to predict the re-\\nlationships between sentences by analyzing them\\nholistically, as well as token-level tasks such as\\nnamed entity recognition and question answering,\\nwhere models are required to produce ﬁne-grained\\noutput at the token level (Tjong Kim Sang and\\nDe Meulder, 2003; Rajpurkar et al., 2016).\\nThere are two existing strategies for apply-\\ning pre-trained language representations to down-\\nstream tasks: feature-based and ﬁne-tuning. The\\nfeature-based approach, such as ELMo (Peters\\net al., 2018a), uses task-speciﬁc architectures that\\ninclude the pre-trained representations as addi-\\ntional features. The ﬁne-tuning approach, such as\\nthe Generative Pre-trained Transformer (OpenAI\\nGPT) (Radford et al., 2018), introduces minimal\\ntask-speciﬁc parameters, and is trained on the\\ndownstream tasks by simply ﬁne-tuning all pre-\\ntrained parameters. The two approaches share the\\nsame objective function during pre-training, where\\nthey use unidirectional language models to learn\\ngeneral language representations.\\nWe argue that current techniques restrict the\\npower of the pre-trained representations, espe-\\ncially for the ﬁne-tuning approaches. The ma-\\njor limitation is that standard language models are\\nunidirectional, and this limits the choice of archi-\\ntectures that can be used during pre-training. For\\nexample, in OpenAI GPT, the authors use a left-to-\\nright architecture, where every token can only at-\\ntend to previous tokens in the self-attention layers\\nof the Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017). Such re-\\nstrictions are sub-optimal for sentence-level tasks,\\nand could be very harmful when applying ﬁne-\\ntuning based approaches to token-level tasks such\\nas question answering, where it is crucial to incor-\\nporate context from both directions.\\nIn this paper, we improve the ﬁne-tuning based\\napproaches by proposing BERT: Bidirectional\\nEncoder Representations from Transformers.\\nBERT alleviates the previously mentioned unidi-\\nrectionality constraint by using a “masked lan-\\nguage model” (MLM) pre-training objective, in-\\nspired by the Cloze task (Taylor, 1953). The\\nmasked language model randomly masks some of\\nthe tokens from the input, and the objective is to\\npredict the original vocabulary id of the masked\\narXiv:1810.04805v2  [cs.CL]  24 May 2019'),\n",

Unlike left-to-\\nright language model pre-training, the MLM ob-\\njective enables the representation to fuse the left\\nand the right context, which allows us to pre-\\ntrain a deep bidirectional Transformer. In addi-\\ntion to the masked language model, we also use\\na “next sentence prediction” task that jointly pre-\\ntrains text-pair representations. The contributions\\nof our paper are as follows:\\n• We demonstrate the importance of bidirectional\\npre-training for language representations. Un-\\nlike Radford et al. (2018), which uses unidirec-\\ntional language models for pre-training, BERT\\nuses masked language models to enable pre-\\ntrained deep bidirectional representations. This\\nis also in contrast to Peters et al. (2018a), which\\nuses a shallow concatenation of independently\\ntrained left-to-right and right-to-left LMs.\\n• We show that pre-trained representations reduce\\nthe need for many heavily-engineered task-\\nspeciﬁc architectures. BERT is the ﬁrst ﬁne-\\ntuning based representation model that achieves\\nstate-of-the-art performance on a large suite\\nof sentence-level and token-level tasks, outper-\\nforming many task-speciﬁc architectures.\\n• BERT advances the state of the art for eleven\\nNLP tasks. The code and pre-trained mod-\\nels are available at https://github.com/\\ngoogle-research/bert.\\n2 Related Work\\nThere is a long history of pre-training general lan-\\nguage representations, and we brieﬂy review the\\nmost widely-used approaches in this section.\\n2.1 Unsupervised Feature-based Approaches\\nLearning widely applicable representations of\\nwords has been an active area of research for\\ndecades, including non-neural (Brown et al., 1992;\\nAndo and Zhang, 2005; Blitzer et al., 2006) and\\nneural (Mikolov et al., 2013; Pennington et al.,\\n2014) methods. Pre-trained word embeddings\\nare an integral part of modern NLP systems, of-\\nfering signiﬁcant improvements over embeddings\\nlearned from scratch (Turian et al., 2010). To pre-\\ntrain word embedding vectors, left-to-right lan-\\nguage modeling objectives have been used (Mnih\\nand Hinton, 2009), as well as objectives to dis-\\ncriminate correct from incorrect words in left and\\nright context (Mikolov et al., 2013).\\nThese approaches have been generalized to\\ncoarser granularities, such as sentence embed-\\ndings (Kiros et al., 2015; Logeswaran and Lee,\\n2018) or paragraph embeddings (Le and Mikolov,\\n2014). To train sentence representations, prior\\nwork has used objectives to rank candidate next\\nsentences (Jernite et al., 2017; Logeswaran and\\nLee, 2018), left-to-right generation of next sen-\\ntence words given a representation of the previous\\nsentence (Kiros et al., 2015), or denoising auto-\\nencoder derived objectives (Hill et al., 2016).\\nELMo and its predecessor (Peters et al., 2017,\\n2018a) generalize traditional word embedding re-\\nsearch along a different dimension. They extract\\ncontext-sensitive features from a left-to-right and a\\nright-to-left language model. The contextual rep-\\nresentation of each token is the concatenation of\\nthe left-to-right and right-to-left representations.\\nWhen integrating contextual word embeddings\\nwith existing task-speciﬁc architectures, ELMo\\nadvances the state of the art for several major NLP\\nbenchmarks (Peters et al., 2018a) including ques-\\ntion answering (Rajpurkar et al., 2016), sentiment\\nanalysis (Socher et al., 2013), and named entity\\nrecognition (Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder,\\n2003). Melamud et al. (2016) proposed learning\\ncontextual representations through a task to pre-\\ndict a single word from both left and right context\\nusing LSTMs. Similar to ELMo, their model is\\nfeature-based and not deeply bidirectional. Fedus\\net al. (2018) shows that the cloze task can be used\\nto improve the robustness of text generation mod-\\nels.\\n2.2 Unsupervised Fine-tuning Approaches\\nAs with the feature-based approaches, the ﬁrst\\nworks in this direction only pre-trained word em-\\nbedding parameters from unlabeled text (Col-\\nlobert and Weston, 2008).\\nMore recently, sentence or document encoders\\nwhich produce contextual token representations\\nhave been pre-trained from unlabeled text and\\nﬁne-tuned for a supervised downstream task (Dai\\nand Le, 2015; Howard and Ruder, 2018; Radford\\net al., 2018). The advantage of these approaches\\nis that few parameters need to be learned from\\nscratch.

Apart from output layers, the same architec-\\ntures are used in both pre-training and ﬁne-tuning. The same pre-trained model parameters are used to initialize\\nmodels for different down-stream tasks. During ﬁne-tuning, all parameters are ﬁne-tuned. [CLS] is a special\\nsymbol added in front of every input example, and [SEP] is a special separator token (e.g. separating ques-\\ntions/answers).\\ning and auto-encoder objectives have been used\\nfor pre-training such models (Howard and Ruder,\\n2018; Radford et al., 2018; Dai and Le, 2015).\\n2.3 Transfer Learning from Supervised Data\\nThere has also been work showing effective trans-\\nfer from supervised tasks with large datasets, such\\nas natural language inference (Conneau et al.,\\n2017) and machine translation (McCann et al.,\\n2017). Computer vision research has also demon-\\nstrated the importance of transfer learning from\\nlarge pre-trained models, where an effective recipe\\nis to ﬁne-tune models pre-trained with Ima-\\ngeNet (Deng et al., 2009; Yosinski et al., 2014).\\n3 BERT\\nWe introduce BERT and its detailed implementa-\\ntion in this section. There are two steps in our\\nframework: pre-training and ﬁne-tuning. Dur-\\ning pre-training, the model is trained on unlabeled\\ndata over different pre-training tasks. For ﬁne-\\ntuning, the BERT model is ﬁrst initialized with\\nthe pre-trained parameters, and all of the param-\\neters are ﬁne-tuned using labeled data from the\\ndownstream tasks. Each downstream task has sep-\\narate ﬁne-tuned models, even though they are ini-\\ntialized with the same pre-trained parameters. The\\nquestion-answering example in Figure 1 will serve\\nas a running example for this section.\\nA distinctive feature of BERT is its uniﬁed ar-\\nchitecture across different tasks. There is mini-\\nmal difference between the pre-trained architec-\\nture and the ﬁnal downstream architecture.\\nModel Architecture BERT’s model architec-\\nture is a multi-layer bidirectional Transformer en-\\ncoder based on the original implementation de-\\nscribed in Vaswani et al. (2017) and released in\\nthe tensor2tensor library.1 Because the use\\nof Transformers has become common and our im-\\nplementation is almost identical to the original,\\nwe will omit an exhaustive background descrip-\\ntion of the model architecture and refer readers to\\nVaswani et al. (2017) as well as excellent guides\\nsuch as “The Annotated Transformer.”2\\nIn this work, we denote the number of layers\\n(i.e., Transformer blocks) as L, the hidden size as\\nH, and the number of self-attention heads as A.3\\nWe primarily report results on two model sizes:\\nBERTBASE (L=12, H=768, A=12, Total Param-\\neters=110M) and BERTLARGE (L=24, H=1024,\\nA=16, Total Parameters=340M).\\nBERTBASE was chosen to have the same model\\nsize as OpenAI GPT for comparison purposes.\\nCritically, however, the BERT Transformer uses\\nbidirectional self-attention, while the GPT Trans-\\nformer uses constrained self-attention where every\\ntoken can only attend to context to its left.4\\n1https://github.com/tensorﬂow/tensor2tensor\\n2http://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/2018/04/03/attention.html\\n3In all cases we set the feed-forward/ﬁlter size to be 4H,\\ni.e., 3072 for the H = 768and 4096 for the H = 1024.\\n4We note that in the literature the bidirectional Trans-'),\n",

A “sequence” refers to the in-\\nput token sequence to BERT, which may be a sin-\\ngle sentence or two sentences packed together.\\nWe use WordPiece embeddings (Wu et al.,\\n2016) with a 30,000 token vocabulary. The ﬁrst\\ntoken of every sequence is always a special clas-\\nsiﬁcation token ( [CLS]). The ﬁnal hidden state\\ncorresponding to this token is used as the ag-\\ngregate sequence representation for classiﬁcation\\ntasks. Sentence pairs are packed together into a\\nsingle sequence. We differentiate the sentences in\\ntwo ways. First, we separate them with a special\\ntoken ([SEP]). Second, we add a learned embed-\\nding to every token indicating whether it belongs\\nto sentence A or sentence B. As shown in Figure 1,\\nwe denote input embedding as E, the ﬁnal hidden\\nvector of the special [CLS] token as C ∈RH,\\nand the ﬁnal hidden vector for the ith input token\\nas Ti ∈RH.\\nFor a given token, its input representation is\\nconstructed by summing the corresponding token,\\nsegment, and position embeddings. A visualiza-\\ntion of this construction can be seen in Figure 2.\\n3.1 Pre-training BERT\\nUnlike Peters et al. (2018a) and Radford et al.\\n(2018), we do not use traditional left-to-right or\\nright-to-left language models to pre-train BERT.\\nInstead, we pre-train BERT using two unsuper-\\nvised tasks, described in this section. This step\\nis presented in the left part of Figure 1.\\nTask #1: Masked LM Intuitively, it is reason-\\nable to believe that a deep bidirectional model is\\nstrictly more powerful than either a left-to-right\\nmodel or the shallow concatenation of a left-to-\\nright and a right-to-left model. Unfortunately,\\nstandard conditional language models can only be\\ntrained left-to-right or right-to-left, since bidirec-\\ntional conditioning would allow each word to in-\\ndirectly “see itself”, and the model could trivially\\npredict the target word in a multi-layered context.\\nformer is often referred to as a “Transformer encoder” while\\nthe left-context-only version is referred to as a “Transformer\\ndecoder” since it can be used for text generation.\\nIn order to train a deep bidirectional representa-\\ntion, we simply mask some percentage of the input\\ntokens at random, and then predict those masked\\ntokens. We refer to this procedure as a “masked\\nLM” (MLM), although it is often referred to as a\\nCloze task in the literature (Taylor, 1953). In this\\ncase, the ﬁnal hidden vectors corresponding to the\\nmask tokens are fed into an output softmax over\\nthe vocabulary, as in a standard LM. In all of our\\nexperiments, we mask 15% of all WordPiece to-\\nkens in each sequence at random. In contrast to\\ndenoising auto-encoders (Vincent et al., 2008), we\\nonly predict the masked words rather than recon-\\nstructing the entire input.\\nAlthough this allows us to obtain a bidirec-\\ntional pre-trained model, a downside is that we\\nare creating a mismatch between pre-training and\\nﬁne-tuning, since the [MASK] token does not ap-\\npear during ﬁne-tuning. To mitigate this, we do\\nnot always replace “masked” words with the ac-\\ntual [MASK] token. The training data generator\\nchooses 15% of the token positions at random for\\nprediction. If the i-th token is chosen, we replace\\nthe i-th token with (1) the [MASK] token 80% of\\nthe time (2) a random token 10% of the time (3)\\nthe unchanged i-th token 10% of the time. Then,\\nTi will be used to predict the original token with\\ncross entropy loss. We compare variations of this\\nprocedure in Appendix C.2.\\nTask #2: Next Sentence Prediction (NSP)\\nMany important downstream tasks such as Ques-\\ntion Answering (QA) and Natural Language Infer-\\nence (NLI) are based on understanding the rela-\\ntionship between two sentences, which is not di-\\nrectly captured by language modeling. In order\\nto train a model that understands sentence rela-\\ntionships, we pre-train for a binarized next sen-\\ntence prediction task that can be trivially gener-\\nated from any monolingual corpus. Speciﬁcally,\\nwhen choosing the sentencesA and B for each pre-\\ntraining example, 50% of the time B is the actual\\nnext sentence that follows A (labeled as IsNext),\\nand 50% of the time it is a random sentence from\\nthe corpus (labeled as NotNext). As we show\\nin Figure 1, C is used for next sentence predic-\\ntion (NSP). 5 Despite its simplicity, we demon-\\nstrate in Section 5.1 that pre-training towards this\\ntask is very beneﬁcial to both QA and NLI. 6\\n5The ﬁnal model achieves 97%-98% accuracy on NSP.\\n6The vector C is not a meaningful sentence representation\\nwithout ﬁne-tuning, since it was trained with NSP.'),\n",

(2017) and\\nLogeswaran and Lee (2018). However, in prior\\nwork, only sentence embeddings are transferred to\\ndown-stream tasks, where BERT transfers all pa-\\nrameters to initialize end-task model parameters.\\nPre-training data The pre-training procedure\\nlargely follows the existing literature on language\\nmodel pre-training. For the pre-training corpus we\\nuse the BooksCorpus (800M words) (Zhu et al.,\\n2015) and English Wikipedia (2,500M words).\\nFor Wikipedia we extract only the text passages\\nand ignore lists, tables, and headers. It is criti-\\ncal to use a document-level corpus rather than a\\nshufﬂed sentence-level corpus such as the Billion\\nWord Benchmark (Chelba et al., 2013) in order to\\nextract long contiguous sequences.\\n3.2 Fine-tuning BERT\\nFine-tuning is straightforward since the self-\\nattention mechanism in the Transformer al-\\nlows BERT to model many downstream tasks—\\nwhether they involve single text or text pairs—by\\nswapping out the appropriate inputs and outputs.\\nFor applications involving text pairs, a common\\npattern is to independently encode text pairs be-\\nfore applying bidirectional cross attention, such\\nas Parikh et al. (2016); Seo et al. (2017). BERT\\ninstead uses the self-attention mechanism to unify\\nthese two stages, as encoding a concatenated text\\npair with self-attention effectively includes bidi-\\nrectional cross attention between two sentences.\\nFor each task, we simply plug in the task-\\nspeciﬁc inputs and outputs into BERT and ﬁne-\\ntune all the parameters end-to-end. At the in-\\nput, sentence A and sentence B from pre-training\\nare analogous to (1) sentence pairs in paraphras-\\ning, (2) hypothesis-premise pairs in entailment, (3)\\nquestion-passage pairs in question answering, and\\n(4) a degenerate text- ∅ pair in text classiﬁcation\\nor sequence tagging. At the output, the token rep-\\nresentations are fed into an output layer for token-\\nlevel tasks, such as sequence tagging or question\\nanswering, and the [CLS] representation is fed\\ninto an output layer for classiﬁcation, such as en-\\ntailment or sentiment analysis.\\nCompared to pre-training, ﬁne-tuning is rela-\\ntively inexpensive. All of the results in the pa-\\nper can be replicated in at most 1 hour on a sin-\\ngle Cloud TPU, or a few hours on a GPU, starting\\nfrom the exact same pre-trained model. 7 We de-\\nscribe the task-speciﬁc details in the correspond-\\ning subsections of Section 4. More details can be\\nfound in Appendix A.5.\\n4 Experiments\\nIn this section, we present BERT ﬁne-tuning re-\\nsults on 11 NLP tasks.\\n4.1 GLUE\\nThe General Language Understanding Evaluation\\n(GLUE) benchmark (Wang et al., 2018a) is a col-\\nlection of diverse natural language understanding\\ntasks. Detailed descriptions of GLUE datasets are\\nincluded in Appendix B.1.\\nTo ﬁne-tune on GLUE, we represent the input\\nsequence (for single sentence or sentence pairs)\\nas described in Section 3, and use the ﬁnal hid-\\nden vector C ∈ RH corresponding to the ﬁrst\\ninput token ([CLS]) as the aggregate representa-\\ntion.

The left-only constraint\\nwas also applied at ﬁne-tuning, because removing\\nit introduced a pre-train/ﬁne-tune mismatch that\\ndegraded downstream performance. Additionally,\\nthis model was pre-trained without the NSP task.\\nThis is directly comparable to OpenAI GPT, but\\nusing our larger training dataset, our input repre-\\nsentation, and our ﬁne-tuning scheme.\\nWe ﬁrst examine the impact brought by the NSP\\ntask. In Table 5, we show that removing NSP\\nhurts performance signiﬁcantly on QNLI, MNLI,\\nand SQuAD 1.1. Next, we evaluate the impact\\nof training bidirectional representations by com-\\nparing “No NSP” to “LTR & No NSP”. The LTR\\nmodel performs worse than the MLM model on all\\ntasks, with large drops on MRPC and SQuAD.\\nFor SQuAD it is intuitively clear that a LTR\\nmodel will perform poorly at token predictions,\\nsince the token-level hidden states have no right-\\nside context. In order to make a good faith at-\\ntempt at strengthening the LTR system, we added\\na randomly initialized BiLSTM on top. This does\\nsigniﬁcantly improve results on SQuAD, but the\\nresults are still far worse than those of the pre-\\ntrained bidirectional models. The BiLSTM hurts\\nperformance on the GLUE tasks.\\nWe recognize that it would also be possible to\\ntrain separate LTR and RTL models and represent\\neach token as the concatenation of the two mod-\\nels, as ELMo does. However: (a) this is twice as\\nexpensive as a single bidirectional model; (b) this\\nis non-intuitive for tasks like QA, since the RTL\\nmodel would not be able to condition the answer\\non the question; (c) this it is strictly less powerful\\nthan a deep bidirectional model, since it can use\\nboth left and right context at every layer.\\n5.2 Effect of Model Size\\nIn this section, we explore the effect of model size\\non ﬁne-tuning task accuracy. We trained a number\\nof BERT models with a differing number of layers,\\nhidden units, and attention heads, while otherwise\\nusing the same hyperparameters and training pro-\\ncedure as described previously.\\nResults on selected GLUE tasks are shown in\\nTable 6. In this table, we report the average Dev\\nSet accuracy from 5 random restarts of ﬁne-tuning.\\nWe can see that larger models lead to a strict ac-\\ncuracy improvement across all four datasets, even\\nfor MRPC which only has 3,600 labeled train-\\ning examples, and is substantially different from\\nthe pre-training tasks. It is also perhaps surpris-\\ning that we are able to achieve such signiﬁcant\\nimprovements on top of models which are al-\\nready quite large relative to the existing literature.\\nFor example, the largest Transformer explored in\\nVaswani et al. (2017) is (L=6, H=1024, A=16)\\nwith 100M parameters for the encoder, and the\\nlargest Transformer we have found in the literature\\nis (L=64, H=512, A=2) with 235M parameters\\n(Al-Rfou et al., 2018). By contrast, BERT BASE\\ncontains 110M parameters and BERT LARGE con-\\ntains 340M parameters.\\nIt has long been known that increasing the\\nmodel size will lead to continual improvements\\non large-scale tasks such as machine translation\\nand language modeling, which is demonstrated\\nby the LM perplexity of held-out training data\\nshown in Table 6. However, we believe that\\nthis is the ﬁrst work to demonstrate convinc-\\ningly that scaling to extreme model sizes also\\nleads to large improvements on very small scale\\ntasks, provided that the model has been sufﬁ-\\nciently pre-trained.

(2016) men-\\ntioned in passing that increasing hidden dimen-\\nsion size from 200 to 600 helped, but increasing\\nfurther to 1,000 did not bring further improve-\\nments. Both of these prior works used a feature-\\nbased approach — we hypothesize that when the\\nmodel is ﬁne-tuned directly on the downstream\\ntasks and uses only a very small number of ran-\\ndomly initialized additional parameters, the task-\\nspeciﬁc models can beneﬁt from the larger, more\\nexpressive pre-trained representations even when\\ndownstream task data is very small.\\n5.3 Feature-based Approach with BERT\\nAll of the BERT results presented so far have used\\nthe ﬁne-tuning approach, where a simple classiﬁ-\\ncation layer is added to the pre-trained model, and\\nall parameters are jointly ﬁne-tuned on a down-\\nstream task. However, the feature-based approach,\\nwhere ﬁxed features are extracted from the pre-\\ntrained model, has certain advantages. First, not\\nall tasks can be easily represented by a Trans-\\nformer encoder architecture, and therefore require\\na task-speciﬁc model architecture to be added.\\nSecond, there are major computational beneﬁts\\nto pre-compute an expensive representation of the\\ntraining data once and then run many experiments\\nwith cheaper models on top of this representation.\\nIn this section, we compare the two approaches\\nby applying BERT to the CoNLL-2003 Named\\nEntity Recognition (NER) task (Tjong Kim Sang\\nand De Meulder, 2003). In the input to BERT, we\\nuse a case-preserving WordPiece model, and we\\ninclude the maximal document context provided\\nby the data.

We use the representation of\\nthe ﬁrst sub-token as the input to the token-level\\nclassiﬁer over the NER label set.\\nTo ablate the ﬁne-tuning approach, we apply the\\nfeature-based approach by extracting the activa-\\ntions from one or more layers without ﬁne-tuning\\nany parameters of BERT. These contextual em-\\nbeddings are used as input to a randomly initial-\\nized two-layer 768-dimensional BiLSTM before\\nthe classiﬁcation layer.\\nResults are presented in Table 7.

This\\ndemonstrates that BERT is effective for both ﬁne-\\ntuning and feature-based approaches.\\n6 Conclusion\\nRecent empirical improvements due to transfer\\nlearning with language models have demonstrated\\nthat rich, unsupervised pre-training is an integral\\npart of many language understanding systems. In\\nparticular, these results enable even low-resource\\ntasks to beneﬁt from deep unidirectional architec-\\ntures. Our major contribution is further general-\\nizing these ﬁndings to deep bidirectional architec-\\ntures, allowing the same pre-trained model to suc-\\ncessfully tackle a broad set of NLP tasks.'),\n",

The purpose of this is to bias the\\nrepresentation towards the actual observed\\nword.\\nThe advantage of this procedure is that the\\nTransformer encoder does not know which words\\nit will be asked to predict or which have been re-\\nplaced by random words, so it is forced to keep\\na distributional contextual representation of ev-\\nery input token. Additionally, because random\\nreplacement only occurs for 1.5% of all tokens\\n(i.e., 10% of 15%), this does not seem to harm\\nthe model’s language understanding capability. In\\nSection C.2, we evaluate the impact this proce-\\ndure.\\nCompared to standard langauge model training,\\nthe masked LM only make predictions on 15% of\\ntokens in each batch, which suggests that more\\npre-training steps may be required for the model'),\n",

The ﬁrst sentence receives the A\\nembedding and the second receives the B embed-\\nding. 50% of the time B is the actual next sentence\\nthat follows A and 50% of the time it is a random\\nsentence, which is done for the “next sentence pre-\\ndiction” task. They are sampled such that the com-\\nbined length is ≤512 tokens. The LM masking is\\napplied after WordPiece tokenization with a uni-\\nform masking rate of 15%, and no special consid-\\neration given to partial word pieces.\\nWe train with batch size of 256 sequences (256\\nsequences * 512 tokens = 128,000 tokens/batch)\\nfor 1,000,000 steps, which is approximately 40\\nepochs over the 3.3 billion word corpus. We\\nuse Adam with learning rate of 1e-4, β1 = 0.9,\\nβ2 = 0.999, L2 weight decay of 0.01, learning\\nrate warmup over the ﬁrst 10,000 steps, and linear\\ndecay of the learning rate. We use a dropout prob-\\nability of 0.1 on all layers. We use a gelu acti-\\nvation (Hendrycks and Gimpel, 2016) rather than\\nthe standard relu, following OpenAI GPT. The\\ntraining loss is the sum of the mean masked LM\\nlikelihood and the mean next sentence prediction\\nlikelihood.\\nTraining of BERT BASE was performed on 4\\nCloud TPUs in Pod conﬁguration (16 TPU chips\\ntotal).13 Training of BERTLARGE was performed\\non 16 Cloud TPUs (64 TPU chips total). Each pre-\\ntraining took 4 days to complete.\\nLonger sequences are disproportionately expen-\\nsive because attention is quadratic to the sequence\\nlength.

Introduction\\nLarge language models (LLM) have revolutionized the approach to mathematical reasoning\\nin artificial intelligence, spurring significant advancements in both the quantitative reasoning\\nbenchmark (Hendrycks et al., 2021) and the geometry reasoning benchmark (Trinh et al., 2024).\\nMoreover, these models have proven instrumental in assisting humans in solving complex\\nmathematical problems (Tao, 2023). However, cutting-edge models such as GPT-4 (OpenAI,\\n2023) and Gemini-Ultra (Anil et al., 2023) are not publicly available, and the currently accessible\\nopen-source models considerably trail behind in performance.\\nIn this study, we introduce DeepSeekMath, a domain-specific language model that signifi-\\ncantly outperforms the mathematical capabilities of open-source models and approaches the\\nperformance level of GPT-4 on academic benchmarks. To achieve this, we create the DeepSeek-\\nMath Corpus, a large-scale high-quality pre-training corpus comprising 120B math tokens. This\\ndataset is extracted from the Common Crawl (CC) using a fastText-based classifier (Joulin et al.,\\n2016). In the initial iteration, the classifier is trained using instances from OpenWebMath (Paster\\net al., 2023) as positive examples, while incorporating a diverse selection of other web pages to\\nserve as negative examples. Subsequently, we employ the classifier to mine additional positive\\ninstances from the CC, which are further refined through human annotation. The classifier is\\nthen updated with this enhanced dataset to improve its performance. The evaluation results\\nindicate that the large-scale corpus is of high quality, as our base model DeepSeekMath-Base\\n7B achieves 64.2% on GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021) and 36.2% on the competition-level MATH\\ndataset (Hendrycks et al., 2021), outperforming Minerva 540B (Lewkowycz et al., 2022a). In\\naddition, the DeepSeekMath Corpus is multilingual, so we notice an improvement in Chinese\\nmathematical benchmarks (Wei et al., 2023; Zhong et al., 2023). We believe that our experience\\nin mathematical data processing is a starting point for the research community, and there is\\nsignificant room for improvement in the future.\\nDeepSeekMath-Base is initialized with DeepSeek-Coder-Base-v1.5 7B (Guo et al., 2024), as\\nwe notice that starting from a code training model is a better choice compared to a general\\nLLM. Furthermore, we observe the math training also improves model capability on MMLU\\n(Hendrycks et al., 2020) and BBH benchmarks (Suzgun et al., 2022), indicating it does not only\\nenhance the model’s mathematical abilities but also amplifies general reasoning capabilities.\\nAfter pre-training, we apply mathematical instruction tuning to DeepSeekMath-Base with\\nchain-of-thought (Wei et al., 2022), program-of-thought (Chen et al., 2022; Gao et al., 2023), and\\ntool-integrated reasoning (Gou et al., 2023) data. The resulting model DeepSeekMath-Instruct\\n7B beats all 7B counterparts and is comparable with 70B open-source instruction-tuned models.\\nFurthermore, we introduce the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a variant rein-\\nforcement learning (RL) algorithm of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) (Schulman et al., 2017).\\nGRPO foregoes the critic model, instead estimating the baseline from group scores, significantly\\nreducing training resources. By solely using a subset of English instruction tuning data, GRPO\\nobtains a substantial improvement over the strong DeepSeekMath-Instruct, including both\\nin-domain (GSM8K: 82.9% →88.2%, MATH: 46.8% →51.7%) and out-of-domain mathematical\\ntasks (e.g., CMATH: 84.6% →88.8%) during the reinforcement learning phase. We also provide\\na unified paradigm to understand different methods, such as Rejection Sampling Fine-Tuning\\n(RFT) (Yuan et al., 2023a), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) (Rafailov et al., 2023), PPO and\\nGRPO. Based on such a unified paradigm, we find that all these methods are conceptualized as\\neither direct or simplified RL techniques. We also conduct extensive experiments, e.g., online\\nv.s. offline training, outcome v.s. process supervision, single-turn v.s. iterative RL and so on,\\n2'),\n",

By implementing a metic-\\nulously designed data selection pipeline, we successfully construct the DeepSeekMath\\nCorpus, a high-quality dataset of 120B tokens from web pages filtered for mathemati-\\ncal content, which is almost 7 times the size of the math web pages used by Minerva\\n(Lewkowycz et al., 2022a) and 9 times the size of the recently released OpenWebMath\\n(Paster et al., 2023).\\n• Our pre-trained base model DeepSeekMath-Base 7B achieves comparable performance\\nwith Minerva 540B (Lewkowycz et al., 2022a), indicating the number of parameters is not\\nthe only key factor in mathematical reasoning capability. A smaller model pre-trained on\\nhigh-quality data could achieve strong performance as well.\\n• We share our findings from math training experiments. Code training prior to math\\ntraining improves models’ ability to solve mathematical problems both with and without\\ntool use. This offers a partial answer to the long-standing question: does code training\\nimprove reasoning abilities?We believe it does, at least for mathematical reasoning.\\n• Although training on arXiv papers is common, especially in many math-related papers, it\\nbrings no notable improvements on all mathematical benchmarks adopted in this paper.\\nExploration and Analysis of Reinforcement Learning\\n• We introduce Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), an efficient and effective\\nreinforcement learning algorithm. GRPO foregoes the critic model, instead estimating\\nthe baseline from group scores, significantly reducing training resources compared to\\nProximal Policy Optimization (PPO).\\n• We demonstrate that GRPO significantly enhances the performance of our instruction-\\ntuned model DeepSeekMath-Instruct, by solely using the instruction-tuning data. Further-\\nmore, we observe enhancements in the out-of-domain performance during the reinforce-\\nment learning process.\\n• We provide a unified paradigm to understand different methods, such as RFT, DPO,\\nPPO, and GRPO.

Math pre-training benefits both language understanding and reasoning\\nperformance.\\n2. Math Pre-Training\\n2.1. Data Collection and Decontamination\\nIn this section, we will outline the process of constructing the DeepSeekMath Corpus from\\nCommon Crawl. As depicted in Figure 2, we present an iterative pipeline that demonstrates\\nhow to systematically gather a large-scale mathematical corpus from Common Crawl, starting\\nwith a seed corpus (e.g., a small but high-quality collection of math-related dataset). It’s worth\\nnoting that this approach is also applicable to other domains, such as coding.\\nFirst, we choose OpenWebMath (Paster et al., 2023), a collection of high-quality mathematical\\nweb texts, as our initial seed corpus. Using this corpus, we train a fastText model (Joulin et al.,\\n2016) to recall more OpenWebMath-like mathematical web pages. Specifically, we randomly\\nselect 500,000 data points from the seed corpus as positive training examples and another\\n500,000 web pages from Common Crawl as negative ones. We employ an open-source library1\\nfor training, configuring the vector dimension to 256, learning rate to 0.1, the maximum length\\n1https://fasttext.cc\\n4'),\n",

To reduce the size of the original Common Crawl, we employ URL-based\\ndeduplication and near-deduplication techniques, resulting in 40B HTML web pages. We then\\nrecall mathematical web pages from deduplicated Common Crawl with the fastText model.\\nTo filter out low-quality mathematical content, we rank the collected pages according to their\\nscores predicted by the fastText model, and only preserve the top-ranking ones. The volume\\nof data preserved is assessed through pre-training experiments on the top 40B, 80B, 120B, and\\n160B tokens. In the first iteration, we choose to keep the top 40B tokens.\\nAfter the first iteration of data collection, numerous mathematical web pages remain un-\\ncollected, mainly because the fastText model is trained on a set of positive examples that lacks\\nsufficient diversity. We therefore identify additional mathematical web sources to enrich the seed\\ncorpus, so that we can optimize the fastText model. Specifically, we first organize the entire Com-\\nmon Crawl into disjoint domains; a domain is defined as web pages sharing the same base URL.\\nFor each domain, we calculate the percentage of web pages that are collected in the first iteration.\\nDomains where over 10% of the web pages have been collected are classified as math-related\\n(e.g., mathoverflow.net ). Subsequently, we manually annotate the URLs associated with\\nmathematical content within these identified domains (e.g., mathoverflow.net/questions).\\nWeb pages linked to these URLs, yet uncollected, will be added to the seed corpus. This ap-\\nproach enables us to gather more positive examples, thereby training an improved fastText\\nmodel capable of recalling more mathematical data in the subsequent iteration. After four\\niterations of data collection, we end up with 35.5M mathematical web pages, totaling 120B\\ntokens. In the fourth iteration, we notice that nearly 98% of the data has already been collected\\nin the third iteration, so we decide to cease data collection.\\nTo avoid benchmark contamination, we follow Guo et al. (2024) to filter out web pages\\ncontaining questions or answers from English mathematical benchmarks such as GSM8K (Cobbe\\net al., 2021) and MATH (Hendrycks et al., 2021) and Chinese benchmarks such as CMATH\\n(Wei et al., 2023) and AGIEval (Zhong et al., 2023). The filtering criteria are as follows: any\\ntext segment containing a 10-gram string that matches exactly with any sub-string from the\\nevaluation benchmarks is removed from our math training corpus. For benchmark texts that\\nare shorter than 10 grams but have at least 3 grams, we employ exact matching to filter out\\ncontaminated web pages.\\n5'),\n",

GRPO foregoes the value model, instead\\nestimating the baseline from group scores, significantly reducing training resources.\\non the rewards {𝑟≥𝑡}and a learned value function 𝑉𝜓. Thus, in PPO, a value function needs to\\nbe trained alongside the policy model and to mitigate over-optimization of the reward model,\\nthe standard approach is to add a per-token KL penalty from a reference model in the reward at\\neach token (Ouyang et al., 2022), i.e.,\\n𝑟𝑡 = 𝑟𝜑(𝑞, 𝑜≤𝑡)−𝛽log 𝜋𝜃(𝑜𝑡|𝑞, 𝑜<𝑡)\\n𝜋𝑟𝑒𝑓 (𝑜𝑡|𝑞, 𝑜<𝑡), (2)\\nwhere 𝑟𝜑 is the reward model, 𝜋𝑟𝑒𝑓 is the reference model, which is usually the initial SFT model,\\nand 𝛽 is the coefficient of the KL penalty.\\nAs the value function employed in PPO is typically another model of comparable size as\\nthe policy model, it brings a substantial memory and computational burden. Additionally,\\nduring RL training, the value function is treated as a baseline in the calculation of the advantage\\nfor variance reduction. While in the LLM context, usually only the last token is assigned a\\nreward score by the reward model, which may complicate the training of a value function that is\\naccurate at each token. To address this, as shown in Figure 4, we propose Group Relative Policy\\nOptimization (GRPO), which obviates the need for additional value function approximation as\\nin PPO, and instead uses the average reward of multiple sampled outputs, produced in response\\nto the same question, as the baseline. More specifically, for each question 𝑞, GRPO samples a\\ngroup of outputs {𝑜1, 𝑜2, ··· , 𝑜𝐺}from the old policy 𝜋𝜃𝑜𝑙𝑑 and then optimizes the policy model\\nby maximizing the following objective:\\nJ𝐺𝑅𝑃𝑂 (𝜃)= E[𝑞∼𝑃(𝑄), {𝑜𝑖}𝐺\\n𝑖=1 ∼𝜋𝜃𝑜𝑙𝑑 (𝑂|𝑞)]\\n1\\n𝐺\\n𝐺∑︁\\n𝑖=1\\n1\\n|𝑜𝑖|\\n|𝑜𝑖|∑︁\\n𝑡=1\\n\\x1a\\nmin\\n\\x14 𝜋𝜃(𝑜𝑖,𝑡|𝑞, 𝑜𝑖,<𝑡)\\n𝜋𝜃𝑜𝑙𝑑 (𝑜𝑖,𝑡|𝑞, 𝑜𝑖,<𝑡)\\nˆ𝐴𝑖,𝑡, clip\\n\\x12 𝜋𝜃(𝑜𝑖,𝑡|𝑞, 𝑜𝑖,<𝑡)\\n𝜋𝜃𝑜𝑙𝑑 (𝑜𝑖,𝑡|𝑞, 𝑜𝑖,<𝑡), 1−𝜀, 1+𝜀\\n\\x13\\nˆ𝐴𝑖,𝑡\\n\\x15\\n−𝛽D𝐾𝐿\\n\\x02\\n𝜋𝜃||𝜋𝑟𝑒𝑓\\n\\x03\\x1b\\n,\\n(3)\\nwhere 𝜀 and 𝛽 are hyper-parameters, and ˆ𝐴𝑖,𝑡 is the advantage calculated based on relative\\nrewards of the outputs inside each group only, which will be detailed in the following subsec-\\ntions. The group relative way that GRPO leverages to calculate the advantages, aligns well with\\nthe comparative nature of rewards models, as reward models are typically trained on datasets\\nof comparisons between outputs on the same question. Also note that, instead of adding KL\\npenalty in the reward, GRPO regularizes by directly adding the KL divergence between the\\ntrained policy and the reference policy to the loss, avoiding complicating the calculation of ˆ𝐴𝑖,𝑡.\\n13'),\n",

Subsequently, these rewards are normalized by subtracting\\nthe group average and dividing by the group standard deviation. Outcome supervision provides\\nthe normalized reward at the end of each output 𝑜𝑖 and sets the advantages ˆ𝐴𝑖,𝑡 of all tokens in\\nthe output as the normalized reward, i.e., ˆ𝐴𝑖,𝑡 = e𝑟𝑖 = 𝑟𝑖−mean(r)\\nstd(r) , and then optimizes the policy by\\nmaximizing the objective defined in equation (3).\\n4.1.3.

Training and Evaluating DeepSeekMath-RL\\nWe conduct RL based on DeepSeekMath-Instruct 7B. The training data of RL are chain-of-\\nthought-format questions related to GSM8K and MATH from the SFT data, which consists\\nof around 144K questions. We exclude other SFT questions to investigate the impact of RL\\non benchmarks that lack data throughout the RL phase. We construct the training set of\\nreward models following (Wang et al., 2023b). We train our initial reward model based on the\\nDeepSeekMath-Base 7B with a learning rate of 2e-5. For GRPO, we set the learning rate of the\\npolicy model as 1e-6. The KL coefficient is 0.04. For each question, we sample 64 outputs. The\\nmax length is set to 1024, and the training batch size is 1024. The policy model only has a single\\nupdate following each exploration stage. We evaluate DeepSeekMath-RL 7B on benchmarks\\nfollowing DeepSeekMath-Instruct 7B. For DeepSeekMath-RL 7B, GSM8K and MATH with\\nchain-of-thought reasoning can be regarded as in-domain tasks and all the other benchmarks\\ncan be regarded as out-of-domain tasks.\\nTable 5 demonstrates the performance of open- and closed-source models with both chain-\\nof-thought and tool-integrated reasoning on English and Chinese benchmarks. We find that:\\n1) DeepSeekMath-RL 7B attains accuracies of 88.2% and 51.7% on GSM8K and MATH, respec-\\ntively, utilizing chain-of-thought reasoning. This performance surpasses that of all open-source\\nmodels in the 7B to 70B range, as well as the majority of closed-source models. 2) Crucially,\\nDeepSeekMath-RL 7B is only trained on chain-of-thought-format instruction tuning data of\\nGSM8K and MATH, starting from DeepSeekMath-Instruct 7B. Despite the constrained scope\\nof its training data, it outperforms DeepSeekMath-Instruct 7B across all evaluation metrics,\\nshowcasing the effectiveness of reinforcement learning.\\n5.

Specifically, Online RFT is comparable to RFT in the early stage of training but\\ngains an absolute advantage in the later stage, demonstrating the superiority of online training.\\nThis is intuitive, as in the initial stage, the actor and the SFT model exhibit close resemblance,\\nwith the sampled data revealing only minor differences.

We divide the reward function as ‘Rule’\\nand ‘Model’ in our experiments. Rule refers to judging the quality of a response based on\\nthe correctness of the answer, and Model denotes that we train a reward model to score each\\nresponse. The training data of the reward model is based on the rule judgment. Equations 10\\nand 21 highlight a key difference between GRPO and Online RFT: GRPO uniquely adjusts its\\ngradient coefficient based on the reward value provided by the reward model. This allows for\\ndifferential reinforcement and penalization of responses according to their varying magnitudes.\\nIn contrast, Online RFT lacks this feature; it does not penalize incorrect responses and uniformly\\nreinforces all responses with correct answers at the same level of intensity.\\nAs demonstrated in Figure 5, GRPO surpasses online RFT, thereby highlighting the efficiency\\nof altering positive and negative gradient coefficients. In addition, GRPO+PS shows superior\\nperformance compared to GRPO+OS, indicating the benefits of using fine-grained, step-aware\\ngradient coefficients. Furthermore, we explore the iterative RL, in our experiments, we conduct\\ntwo rounds of iteration. As shown in Figure 6, we notice that the iterative RL significantly\\nimproves the performance, especially at the first iteration.\\n20'),\n",

It was noted that RL enhances Maj@K but not Pass@K.\\n5.2.2. Why RL Works?\\nIn this paper, we conduct reinforcement learning based on a subset of instruction tuning\\ndata, and it achieves significant performance enhancement upon the instruction tuning model.\\nTo further explain why reinforcement learning works. We evaluate the Pass@K and Maj@K\\naccuracy of the Instruct and RL models on two benchmarks. As shown in Figure 7, RL enhances\\nMaj@K’s performance but not Pass@K. These findings indicate that RL enhances the model’s\\noverall performance by rendering the output distribution more robust, in other words, it seems\\nthat the improvement is attributed to boosting the correct response from TopK rather than\\nthe enhancement of fundamental capabilities. Similarly, (Wang et al., 2023a) identified a\\nmisalignment problem in reasoning tasks within the SFT model, showing that the reasoning\\nperformance of SFT models can be improved through a series of preference alignment strategies\\n(Song et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023a; Yuan et al., 2023b).\\n5.2.3. How to Achieve More Effective RL?\\nWe demonstrate RL works pretty well in mathematical reasoning tasks. We also provide a unified\\nparadigm to understand different representative training methods. Within this paradigm, all\\nmethods are conceptualized as either direct or simplified RL techniques. As summarized in\\nEquation 5, there exist three key components: Data Source, Algorithm, and Reward Function.\\nWe provide some potential future directions about the three components.\\nData Source Data source is the raw material of all training methods. In the context of RL, we\\nspecifically refer to the data source as the unlabeled questions with the outputs sampled from\\nthe policy model. In this paper, we only use the questions from the instruction tuning stage and\\na naive nucleus sampling to sample outputs. We think this is a potential reason that our RL\\npipeline only improves the Maj@K performance. In the future, we will explore our RL pipeline\\non out-of-distribution question prompts, in conjunction with advanced sampling (decoding)\\nstrategies, like those based on tree-search methods (Yao et al., 2023).

Based on Equation 5, to some extent, all methods now fully TRUST the\\nsignal of the reward function to increase or decrease the conditional probability of a certain\\ntoken. However, it is impossible to ensure the reward signal is always reliable, especially in\\nextremely complex tasks. For example, even the PRM800K datasets (Lightman et al., 2023),\\nwhich have been carefully annotated by well-trained annotators, still contain approximately 20%\\nof incorrectly annotations7. To this end, we will explore the reinforcement learning algorithm\\nthat is robust against noisy reward signals. We believe such WEAK-TO-STRONG (Burns et al.,\\n2023) alignment methods will bring a fundamental change to the learning algorithms.\\nReward Function Reward function is the source of the training signal. In RL, the reward\\nfunction is usually the neural reward model. We think there exist three important directions for\\nreward models: 1) How to enhance the generalization ability of the reward model. The reward\\nmodel must be effectively generalized to handle out-of-distribution questions and advanced\\ndecoding outputs; otherwise, reinforcement learning may merely stabilize the distribution of\\nLLMs rather than improve their fundamental capabilities; 2) How to reflect the uncertainty\\nof reward model. The uncertainty could potentially act as a linking bridge between the weak\\nreward model and the weak-to-strong learning algorithms; 3) How to efficiently build high-\\nquality process reward models that can provide fine-grained training signals for the reasoning\\nprocess (Lightman et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023b).\\n6. Conclusion, Limitation, and Future Work\\nWe present DeepSeekMath, which outperforms all open-source models on the competition-\\nlevel MATH benchmark and approaches the performance of closed models. DeepSeekMath is\\ninitialized with DeepSeek-Coder-v1.5 7B and undergoes continual training for 500B tokens, with\\na significant component of the training data being 120B math tokens sourced from Common\\nCrawl. Our extensive ablation study shows web pages offer significant potential for high-quality\\nmathematical data, while arXiv may not as beneficial as we expected. We introduce Group\\nRelative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a variant of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), which\\ncan notably improve mathematical reasoning capabilities with less memory consumption. The\\nexperiment results show that GRPO is effective even if DeepSeekMath-Instruct 7B has reached\\na high score on benchmarks. We also provide a unified paradigm to understand a series of\\nmethods and summarize several potential directions for more effective reinforcement learning.\\nAlthough DeepSeekMath achieves impressive scores on quantitative reasoning benchmarks,\\nits capability on geometry and theorem-proof are relatively weaker than closed models. For\\ninstance, in our dry run, the model cannot handle problems related to triangles and ellipses,\\nwhich may indicate data selection bias in pre-training and fine-tuning. In addition, restricted\\nby the model scale, DeepSeekMath is worse than GPT-4 on few-shot capability. GPT-4 could\\nimprove its performance with few-shot inputs, while DeepSeekMath shows similar performance\\nin zero-shot and few-shot evaluation. In the future, we will further improve our engineered\\ndata selection pipeline to construct more high-quality pre-trained corpus. In addition, we will\\nexplore the potential directions (Section 5.2.3) for more effective reinforcement learning of LLMs.\\n7https://github.com/openai/prm800k/issues/12#issuecomment-1728491852\\n22'),\n",

Recently,\\nMikolov et al. (2013c) introduced a new evalua-\\ntion scheme based on word analogies that probes\\nthe ﬁner structure of the word vector space by ex-\\namining not the scalar distance between word vec-\\ntors, but rather their various dimensions of dif-\\nference. For example, the analogy “king is to\\nqueen as man is to woman” should be encoded\\nin the vector space by the vector equation king −\\nqueen = man −woman. This evaluation scheme\\nfavors models that produce dimensions of mean-\\ning, thereby capturing the multi-clustering idea of\\ndistributed representations (Bengio, 2009).\\nThe two main model families for learning word\\nvectors are: 1) global matrix factorization meth-\\nods, such as latent semantic analysis (LSA) (Deer-\\nwester et al., 1990) and 2) local context window'),\n",
